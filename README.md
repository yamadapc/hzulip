A haskell wrapper for the zulip API.

## Installing
Simply installing through cabal with `cabal install hzulip` should do it.

## Usage
### Getting started
```haskell
import           Control.Monad.IO.Class
import           Web.HZulip

main :: IO ()
main = withZulipCreds "zulip-api-user" "zulip-api-key" $ do
  -- Since we are inside the ZulipM ReaderT monad transformer, we
  -- don't need to pass options around. The above function already
  -- created an HTTP manager, for connection pooling and wrapped the
  -- default configuration options with the Monad:
  liftIO . print =<< getSubscriptions
  -- >> ["haskell"]

  -- Sending messages is as easy as:
  _msgId <- sendStreamMessage "haskell"              -- message stream
                              "hzulip"               -- message topic
                              "Message from Haskell" -- message content

  -- Before receiving messages, our client needs to be subscribed to streams
  _streamNames <- addAllSubscriptions

  -- Listening for events works with a callback based API:
  onNewMessage $ \msg -> do
    liftIO $ putStrLn "Got a new message!"
    let usr = messageSender msg
        fn = userFullName usr
        e = userEmail usr

    _privateMsgId <- sendPrivateMessage [e] $ "Thanks for the message " ++ fn ++ "!!"
    return ()
```

## Documentation
The best resource on this is naturally its haddock documentation, available at
[yamadapc.github.io/hzulip](https://yamadapc.github.io/hzulip). You might also
be interested in the [zulip API documentation](https://zulip.com/api/) as well.

## Examples
There are a couple of example bots and applications on the
[`examples`](https://github.com/yamadapc/hzulip/tree/master/examples) directory. If you're getting started with Haskell, I'd
suggest looking at the [`ZulipLogger`](https://github.com/yamadapc/hzulip/blob/master/examples/src/ZulipLogger.hs) and
[`ZulipEchoBot`](https://github.com/yamadapc/hzulip/blob/master/examples/src/ZulipEchoBot.hs) which show of basic API usage
with minimal noise from anything else.

## A higher-level API
A [`Conduit`](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/snoyberg/library-documentation/conduit-overview)
API is provided as well and an "echo" example is available for it in the
examples directory; [here](https://github.com/yamadapc/hzulip/blob/master/examples/src/ZulipConduitBot.hs). You can compare the evented implementation and see which you
like best. Right now using streams to handle output is a bit unhandy, but it
provides a nice composable high-level interface for the events.

Other than the echo and logger examples; there's also a pretty logger at [`ZulipCli`](https://github.com/yamadapc/hzulip/blob/master/examples/src/ZulipCli.hs).

## A remote evaluation bot
Though slightly outdated, there's a remote evaluation Zulip bot using this
library at [zulip-eval-bot](https://github.com/yamadapc/zulip-eval-bot), which
might be worth taking a look at as well.
